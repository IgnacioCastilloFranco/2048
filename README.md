# 2048 Game 

A browser-based implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game, built with vanilla JavaScript and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Use the **arrow keys** (↑ ↓ ← →) to slide all tiles in that direction
2. When two tiles with the **same number** collide, they **merge into one** with their sum
3. After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears randomly on the board
4. Try to reach the **2048 tile** to win!
5. The game ends when no more moves are possible

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Open directly
Simply double-click `index.html` to open the game in your default browser.

### Option 2: Local server (recommended)
```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

### Option 3:  🐳 Docker

This project is static and can be served from any static HTTP server. The repository includes a Dockerfile that uses nginx to serve the site.

Build the image locally:

```powershell
docker build -t 2048-game .
```

Run the container (maps port 8080 on your machine to port 80 in the container):

```powershell
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 --name 2048-web 2048-game
```

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

Alternatively, use docker-compose:

```powershell
docker-compose up --build
```

Notes:
- `.dockerignore` is included to keep the build context small.

## ✨ Features

- **Smooth Animations** — tiles scale up when merged using CSS keyframes
- **Score Tracking** — current score and best score display
- **Win Detection** — celebration screen when reaching 2048
- **Game Over Detection** — alerts when no more moves available
- **Responsive Layout** — centered grid with score panel on the right

## 🛠️ Technologies

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **HTML5** | Page structure |
| **CSS3** | Animations (keyframes), custom properties |
| **JavaScript (ES6+)** | Game logic, DOM manipulation |
| **Tailwind CSS (CDN)** | Utility-first styling |

## 📝 Game Logic Overview

1. **Tile Spawning** — Adds a 2 (60% chance) or 4 (40% chance) to a random empty cell
2. **Move Handling** — Slides and merges tiles in the pressed direction
3. **Merge Animation** — CSS `scaleUp` keyframes create a pop effect
4. **Win/Lose Check** — Detects 2048 tile or no available moves

## 🔧 Development Notes

- **No build step required** — Uses Tailwind CDN for quick prototyping
- **CSS Custom Properties** — `--tx` and `--ty` store tile positions for smooth transforms
